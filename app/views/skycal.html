        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>Skycal is an event calendar for astronomical events. This web application uses React/Redux, MongoDB, Node, SASS, and Webpack. Check out the work in progress version at <a href="http://skycalapp.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">skycalapp.herokuapp.com</a>.</p>
        
        <p class="port-main-section-end">The idea came from a need for a good astronomical calendar of events. Most astronomy calendars are very poorly designed or not regularly updated. Since buying a telescope for my significant other, I have decided that solving this need would be a great opportunity to do some fun design and development!</p>

        <h3>Planning Stage</h3>
        <p class="port-main-section-end">For this project, I am working with a Full Stack Engineer. Originally, we decided on experimenting with a Python/React/Webpack web application. After realizing our small application would be unnecessarily complicated and heavy using Python, we abandoned it and settled on a React/Redux, MongoDB, Node, SASS, and Webpack application. It was surprising how long it took to just decide on the technologies and frameworks we were going to use with this project.</p>

        <h3>Wireframing</h3>
        <p class="port-main-section-end">Starting this design consisted of a quick brainstorming session and wireframing. I worked with the other Engineer to come up with a good game plan before started the high fidelity mockups.</p>

        <h3>First Mock Ups</h3>
        <p class="port-main-section-end">My initial thought is that the first view would show upcoming events. Then when the user clicks more, the window would expand to show a more detailed calendar version. Some other fun things I have decided to incorporate into the design is icons representing astronomical events and a nice cool color scheme. The first high fidelity mock ups are below.</p>

        <h3>Mobile Mock Ups</h3>
        <p class="port-main-section-end">Once the desktop version has been built out, the next step would be to make a React Native application. The end goal for this project would be to have the app send notifications for astronomical events. This way users can plan ahead and be in the right place, at the right time to view events. Here are some initial thoughts on what the mobile version would look like.</p>

        <h3>A Work in Progress</h3>
        <p>Through countless trial and error, a couple new repos, and many design changes, Skycal has been coming along nicely. Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/imjohsep" target="_blank">imjohsep</a>, a light weight React/Redux application with Webpack and Node was built. We collaborated together on a <a href="https://github.com/imjohsep/skycal-redux" target="_blank">Github repo</a> to create modular Javascript components that were readable and small. Though the CSS is not entirely modular currently, it was important that we got a working, beautiful version of Skycal public so that we could show it off to our friends and family.</p>

        <p class="port-main-section-end">Skycal is also responsive and looks great on mobile devices as well! Personally, I think our web application is much more beautiful on a mobile device. The svg icons and fonts look so sharp on retina devices. Make sure you check it out. <a href="http://skycalapp.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">skycalapp.herokuapp.com</a></p>

        <h3>Next Steps</h3>
        <p class="port-main-section-end">I'll be working on breaking down our CSS/Sass into more manageable, sensible files. Along with that, I'm throughly excited to start incorporating animations and transitions. React has been exciting to learn and truly powerful to develop with; I'm looking forward to continue to work on Skycal.</p>
