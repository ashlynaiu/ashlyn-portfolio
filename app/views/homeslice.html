        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>Homeslice is a roommate, household management app. It is a web app that can be downloaded for both iOS and Android.</p>

        <h3>The Challenge</h3>
        <p>Because one app is used for both Android and iOS, it was very difficult to find a balance in using icons and UX patterns that both users would understand. Icons and interactions are very different on both platform, combining them means going back to the drawing board.</p>

        <h3>First Mockups</h3>
        <p>Thankfully, this was one of the few projects that I was working on that had an interface and structure that users already enjoyed and used daily. However, the interface was cluttered and felt very inconsistent. The first task was to go in and translate the photoshop mockups to sketch. Assets from photoshop are rasterized and don’t scale nicely like svgs. This sketch file would them need a reskin that would be the basis for how the app would continue to grow in the feature.</p>

        <h3>New Features</h3>
        <p>As the reskin came along, the Homeslice Team decided to added some extra features and functionality. One of the biggest additions was the “Quick Message." After the explosion of the "Yo" app, the team decided that our audience might enjoy this fast pace communication system. Since I already had great mockups, and sketch allows for quick iteration, I designed the new feature straight in Sketch, rather than on paper. I then prototyped the new design in Flinto. Due to disagreements in compensation (or complete lack there of), I have removed the Flinto app from being publicly accessed. But I would be happy to share it with anyone interested.</p>
