Thanks for taking the time to learn more about my design journey. To put it briefly, I've worked on numerous teams varying in size, goals, and talents. While I consider myself a designer, I'm always digging deep into code to push the limits of my creations. Just recently, I started working at Salesforce on their <a href="http://www.salesforce.com/industries/financial-services/financialservices-cloud/" target="_blank">Financial Services Team</a> as a Product Designer.</p> <p>Previously I worked at <a href="https://www.zenefits.com/" target="_blank">Zenefits</a> as an UI Engineer. Here, I focused on building reusable and tested EmberJS components, helped level up Full-Stack Engineers on front-end technologies, and contributed to feature work. Specifically, I worked on the Benefits Plan Shopping Team where I engineered brand new user flows and components.</p> <p>Before Zenefits I worked at a small startup called <a href="https://www.icracked.com/" target="_blank">iCracked</a> as a Product Designer. Working on a very small Product and Engineering team, I had the unique experience bringing web applications from initial mock ups, all the way to final implementation into production. I also maintained their AngularJS component library and built a custom sass framework that allowed engineers to build basic landing pages quickly.</p> <p>However, some of my favorite work has been with side projects. Be sure to check out my portfolio to see all the designs and repositories I've contributed too.</p> </div> </div> </div>
