During my free time, I enjoy rock climbing, cycling, and backpacking. Currently, I'm working full-time at iCracked as a Product Designer. I enjoy prototyping designs and making delightful interactions using Javascript, HTML, and CSS3/SASS. My most current projects have been mocked up in Sketch/Adobe Illustrator and then built into AngularJS web apps. While I have worn maybe hats during product launches, including A/B testing and wireframing, I find myself enjoying UI Development the most. </p> <p>Previously, I worked at Etna Interactive as a Web Developer. I've also had the opportunity to work part-time as the Lead Creative and Co-Founder of a start-up called Prelimb. And I've helped with an app redesign for the startup, Homeslice. Feel free to contact me if you have questions.</p> </div> </div> </div>
