The product quickly evolved during it's creation and the business decided to offer a Protection membership. Customers could purchase the protection membership and get inexpensive repairs. The new dashboard would need to accommodate devices from customers who where both members and non-members to the Advantage Plan Program.</p> <img src="/images/port-icracked-1.a9286b03.jpg" class="port-main-img"> <h3>Challenge</h3> <p>The iCracked dashboard was a complex product that needed to be robust, yet simple for customers to navigate. Customers needed to be able to view Advantage plan perks, request repairs or trade-ins, update billing and account information, review the history of an account, as well as a handful of other actions. </p> <p class="port-main-section-end">Since the product was starting from scratch, there was little data we could pull together to bring in user input or research. The project would have to be released early, tested, and continuous modified. </p> <h3>Information Architecture</h3> <p class="port-main-section-end">The team consisted of two Product Designers and one Full-Stack Developer. Working with the team, we used post-it notes to map out how we thought the different views and flows should be linked together. Quick whiteboard sessions and online discovery occurred to get ideas flowing. </p> <img src="/images/port-icracked-3.d59fe879.jpg" class="port-main-img"> <h3>Component Creation</h3> <p>After the initial mockups were created, the team decided how the design could be broken apart to create reusable components. Since the project was going to be very large, we knew that starting off thinking modally would be key. </p> <p class="port-main-section-end">Using the mockups, I created the final components that would be used during the product creation. I meticulously coded the components; making AngularJS directives or simple html/css tables.</p> <img src="/images/port-icracked-2.a0f10aa7.jpg" class="port-main-img-border"> <h3>Phase One</h3> <p class="port-main-section-end">Phase One of the project took about 2 months to complete. When the product goals shifted slightly to be focused more on Advantage Plan Memberships, the team realized that the needs of the users were not going to be met. Sharing phase one around the office and with friends/family, we knew that the flow would have to be optimized for Protection Plan.</p> <img src="/images/port-icracked-4.0917d83f.jpg" class="port-main-img-border"> <h3>Phase Two</h3> <p>Because the app was originally built so modally, myself and a Full Stack Engineers were able to go back to the Dashboard, reskin the design, and improve the user flows in exactly five days. The Product is now live and being AB tested for future optimization.</p> </section> </div>
