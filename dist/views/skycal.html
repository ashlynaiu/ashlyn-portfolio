This is currently just a side project still in the works! But you can check here to see how progress is going. The repository for the application is <a href="https://github.com/imjohsep/skycal" target="_blank">here</a>.</p> <h3>Planning Stage</h3> <p class="port-main-section-end">For this project, I am working with a close friend who is doing the backend data management. We decided to do a little more experimenting with this project and are going after making a Python/React/Webpack application.</p> <p class="port-main-section-end">The idea came from a need for a good astronomical calendar of events. Most astronomy calendars are very poorly designed or not regularly updated. Since buying a telescope for my significant other, I have decided that solving this need would be a great opportunity to do some fun design and development!</p> <img src="/images/port-skycal-4.c4a33990.jpg" class="port-main-img"> <h3>Wireframing</h3> <p class="port-main-section-end">While the Backend Engineer is currently setting up the data models and python processing, I have been working on some initial designs. Starting this design consisted of a quick brainstorming session and wireframing. I worked with the Backend Engineer to come up with a good game plan before started the high fidelity mockups.</p> <h3>First Mock Ups</h3> <p class="port-main-section-end">My initial thought is that the first view would show upcoming events. Then when the user clicks more, the window would expand to show a more detailed calendar version. Some other fun things I have decided to incorporate into the design is icons representing astronomical events and a nice cool color scheme. The first high fidelity mock ups are below.</p> <img src="/images/port-skycal-1.68702fbe.png" class="port-main-img"> <img src="/images/port-skycal-2.c108e392.png" class="port-main-img"> <img src="/images/port-skycal-3.3f7fd0ff.png" class="port-main-img"> <h3>Mobile Mock Ups</h3> <p class="port-main-section-end">Once the desktop version has been built out, the next step would be to make a React Native application. The end goal for this project would be to have the app send notifications for astronomical events. This way users can plan ahead and be in the right place, at the right time to view events. Here are some initial thoughts on what the mobile version would look like.</p> <img src="/images/port-skycal-5.58661c22.png" class="port-main-img"> <img src="/images/port-skycal-6.445d548a.png" class="port-main-img"> <img src="/images/port-skycal-7.75cf44ba.png" class="port-main-img"> <h3>New Updated</h3> <p class="port-main-section-end">The React app has finally been built out thanks to <a href="https://github.com/imjohsep" target="_blank">Joseph Watters</a>. I've been slowly adding in CSS styles, including <a ui-sref="style-guide">a custom SASS framework</a> that I like to start projects with. I've also be playing around a lot with CSS transitions and animations. There is still a lot to be done on it, but you can <a href="https://github.com/imjohsep/skycal-redux" target="_blank">check out the repository</a>. Feel free to clone and mess around with it. Its a pretty fun, basic web app!</p> </section> </div>
