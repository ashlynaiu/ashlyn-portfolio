        <p>When reviewing activity in Salesforce, logged calls, meetings, tasks, and emails are simply not enough to give the user a clear understanding of how a relationship or project is progressing. Users need a central hub to see what happened on the account last, what is happening next, and what they can do to move the needle. Without activity insights alongside other related updates, users loose context and transparency into the overall business process.</p>

          <li>"Allow me to see why activities are happening? What are these activities relating to?"</li>
          <li>"Allow me to visualize automation happening on the account so that I can clearly understand what needs to happen next"</li>
          <li>"Component needs to be accessed on mobile devices."</li>
          <li>"Component doesnâ€™t scale well when there is too much activity. UI requires that I have to constantly adjust the layout manually which is too time consuming."</li>
