          <h2>Product Designer</h2>
          <p className="first">Currently I am a Architect of Product Design for <a href="https://appexchange.salesforce.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AppExchange</a>, Salesforce's Enterprise App Marketplace. Before AppExchange I was a Product Design Lead at <a href="https://quip.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Quip</a> where I helped the Product team reimagined how collaboration and siloed CRM data might intersect. I was also one of the first designers on <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/products/financial-services-cloud/overview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Financial Services Cloud</a> where I helped define and design their 5 year roadmap. </p>

          <p>While Product Design is my main focus now, I was previously a UI Engineer at <a href="https://www.zenefits.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zenefits</a> and also got to wear numerous hats at iCracked as a Product Designer and Engineer.</p>

          <p>The work presented on this website is just quick glimpses into projects that have been publically launched.</p>
