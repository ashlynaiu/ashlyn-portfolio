          <h2>Product Designer and UX/UI Engineer</h2>
          <p className="first">Currently I am a Architect of Product Design for <a href="https://appexchange.salesforce.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AppExchange</a>, Salesforce's Enterprise App Marketplace. Before AppExchange I was a Product Design Lead at <a href="https://quip.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Quip</a> where I helped the Product team reimagined how collaboration and siloed CRM data might intersect. I was also one of the first designers on <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/products/financial-services-cloud/overview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Financial Services Cloud</a> where I helped define and design their 5 year roadmap. </p>

          <p>While Product Design is my main focus now, I was previously a UI Engineer at <a href="https://www.zenefits.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zenefits</a> and also got to wear numerous hats at iCracked as a Designer and Engineer. I enjoy being apart of the entire product lifecycle; from inital customer discovery and research to creating React prototypes and high fidelity mocks.</p>

          <p>These case studies are just quick glimpses into my favorite problems and solutions I have tackled over the last five years. Please reach out through <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pub/ashlyn-aiu/42/56b/60a" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Linkedin</a> to learn more about my process and projects.</p>
