Before working for the Quip team at Salesforce, I was on the Financial Services Cloud team. While Product Design is my main focus now, I was previously a UI Engineer at <a href="https://www.zenefits.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zenefits</a> and also got to wear numerous hats at <a href="https://www.icracked.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">iCracked</a> as a Designer and Engineer. I enjoy being apart of the entire product lifecycle; from inital customer discovery and research to creating React prototypes and high fidelity mocks.</p>
