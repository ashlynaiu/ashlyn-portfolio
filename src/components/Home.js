          <h2>Product Designer and UX/UI Engineer</h2>
          <p className="first">Currently I am a Product Designer at <a href="https://quip.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Quip</a>, a Salesforce company. Before working for the Quip team at Salesforce, I was on the Financial Services Cloud team. While Product Design is my main focus now, I was previously a UI Engineer at <a href="https://www.zenefits.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zenefits</a> and also got to wear numerous hats at <a href="https://www.icracked.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">iCracked</a> as a Designer and Engineer. I enjoy being apart of the entire product lifecycle; from inital customer discovery and research to creating React prototypes and high fidelity mocks.</p>

          <p>These case studies are just quick glimpses into my favorite problems and solutions I have tackled over the last five years. Please reach out through <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pub/ashlyn-aiu/42/56b/60a" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">linkedin</a> to learn more about my process and projects.</p>
